Having this array 
const students = [
  { id: 1, name: "Ali", grade: 80, city: "Cairo" },
  { id: 2, name: "Sara", grade: 92, city: "Alexandria" },
  { id: 3, name: "Omar", grade: 74, city: "Giza" },
  { id: 4, name: "Mona", grade: 88, city: "Cairo" }
];

do the following using arrow function 
1- Create a new array that contains only the names of students using arrow functions.

2-Get all students who have a grade greater than or equal to 85.(filter)

3-Find the student whose name is "Sara".

4-Calculate the average grade of all students.(reduce)

5-Sort students by grade (descending) using arrow function in sort.

6-Print Students using forEach arr fun 

7-Make a shallow copy of the students array using spread.

8-Add a new student object into the array using spread.

9-Suppose you have another array of students, merge it with the first array using spread

10- Update "Omar"â€™s grade to 95 without mutating the original array (use spread inside map).

11-Remove the student with id = 2 using filter + spread.

12- Take out the first student and keep the rest in another array using destructuring + spread

13- destruct and Extract the first student into a variable, and keep the rest into another array using rest 

14- Skip the first two students and store the third one in a variable.

15-
